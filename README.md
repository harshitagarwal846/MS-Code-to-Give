Developed DREAM-WEB, a website that tackles all MVPs and add-ons for challenges Banglore Breads faces.

It engages the user with a non-judgemental questionnaire and presents them with their addiction state and recommendations for counseling and rehab services, accordingly being anonymous.

It also has an emotion detection section where the user enters his sufferings, and the model predicts his feelings to try to motivate him and stores data for connecting him with a specialized counselor in the future.

Each user is given a token id generated from the questionnaire to sign on to the site quickly, but the user can sign/login without the same.

Resources and success story pages are present for user interaction.

The site also has a dashboard for the admin where all the data crunching happens. The data collected from the survey is analyzed and presented to the admin in the form of interactive charts.

The sideboard contains the link to the QR code, which the admin can share or download based on their need.
